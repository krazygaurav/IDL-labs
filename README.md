# IDL-labs

1. Ex1
Learn about basic tensorflow 2.0 functions. Create a custom MLP (Multi-Layer-Perceptron) model for MNIST dataset. Do some visualization and answering some important question about the Neural layer architecture. 

2. Ex2
There are 5 bad scripts following some MLP architecture but produce very low accuracy on MNIST dataset. Using TensorBoard, find out why?.  
Hint: There is no error with Neural network. 
Learning about tf.data module. Using tf.data module for MNIST dataset. 
Learning about repeat, shuffle, batch process in tf.data and understand which order makes sense.
